<h1>Pair Programming</h1>
<p>Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.</p>
<p>The goal of pair programming is to produce higher quality code, by having two people work together to review each other's work and to catch any errors or bugs.</p>
<p>Pair programming can also be used as a teaching tool, as it allows more experienced programmers to share their knowledge with less experienced programmers.</p>
<p>To learn more about pair programming, check out the following resources:</p>
